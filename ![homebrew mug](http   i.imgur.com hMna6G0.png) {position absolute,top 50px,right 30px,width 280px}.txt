# introduction

A dungeon master once told me, that every charachter in dungeons and dragons is a realization of a player's fantasy. Zenoninsm has started and my own escapism. 
I'm an married and a father to two --- load of day to day escapism from borgamnot ---

I wanted to think, and I wanted to have uncontrolled, be impolsive have fun and wonder between me and myself what is wrong with that

this is not a proposition for somthing to belive in. it is just escapism and a good and fun one, one that role-playing and dnd can provide.

It started with Derion III, and continued as thoughts that evolved to a full phylosohpy perspective and a religion a fictional fun charechter cna follow.

at last it bacame somthing that I thought was worth to share, somthing that can help other achive escapism, get insighits on themselves, add unique flavour to thier charechters and campaings and also have fun.

This book conatins the main principles of Zenonism as a religion-phylosophical perspective, so that the reader could get what this is all about. A guide on my thoughts on how Zenonism can participate in a campaign or a world setting. And some more concrete matirial that I have made as part of my planned campaigns and charechters I had in mind.

would love to recive feedback on this...

There is really no definite answer. Even if there was, it is still a wonderful playground for the creation of  
A series of events
